Iris Flower Classification\n


Overview
This project focuses on classifying the species of Iris flowers—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using machine learning techniques.
The dataset contains features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to predict the flower's species.


 
Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics, available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
**Target:**


Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica
**Tech stack**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:

1.pandas for data manipulation

2.numpy for numerical computation

3.matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

4.scikit-learn for machine learning models

**Project Workflow**

Data Preprocessing:




1.Load the dataset.

2.Handle missing values (if any).

3.Split the data into training and testing sets.

4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):



**Visualize relationships between features.**

a)Identify trends and patterns in the dataset.

**Model Building:**



a)Train multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

b)Tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

**Model Evaluation:**

a)Compare models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

b)Use a confusion matrix for better understanding.

**How to Run the Project**

1) Clone the Repository=git clone https://github.com/Yashvardhan0904/Iris-flower-classification-.git

2)Navigate to the Project Directory:cd Iris-flower-classification-

3)Install Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries using:pip install -r requirements.txt

**Results**

a)Best Model: Logistic Regression (Example)

b) Accuracy: 96.7%

**Features**

a)Exploratory Data Analysis with insightful visualizations.

b)Implementation of multiple machine learning models.

c)Comparison of model performance with metrics.
