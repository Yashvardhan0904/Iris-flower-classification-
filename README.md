# Iris-flower-classification-
 Iris Flower Classification: Classify iris flowers into species based  on sepal and petal measurements.







This is the data discription of data :-
This is the statistical summary of the Iris dataset's numerical features generated by the `describe()` method in pandas. Here's what the output means:

| **Metric**    | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **count**      | The number of non-missing values in each column. In this case, all columns have 150 entries. |
| **mean**       | The average value for each column.                                             |
| **std**        | The standard deviation, showing the spread or variability of the data.         |
| **min**        | The smallest value in each column.                                             |
| **25%**        | The first quartile (Q1), below which 25% of the data lies.                     |
| **50%**        | The median (Q2), where half the data lies below this value.                    |
| **75%**        | The third quartile (Q3), below which 75% of the data lies.                     |
| **max**        | The largest value in each column.                                              |

### Insights:
1. **Sepal Length**:
   - Varies from 4.3 to 7.9 cm, with an average of 5.84 cm.
   - The interquartile range (IQR) is \( 6.4 - 5.1 = 1.3 \), indicating moderate spread.

2. **Sepal Width**:
   - Varies from 2.0 to 4.4 cm, with an average of 3.05 cm.
   - The standard deviation is 0.43, meaning most values are close to the mean.

3. **Petal Length**:
   - Varies widely from 1.0 to 6.9 cm, with an average of 3.76 cm.
   - The large standard deviation (1.76) reflects significant variation among species.

4. **Petal Width**:
   - Ranges from 0.1 to 2.5 cm, with an average of 1.20 cm.
   - Higher variability among species is also evident here.
